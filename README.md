#### Our MVP
- As a user...
    - I want to be able to make comments in a popup.
    - I want my comments associated with the video's time at the point that I start typing a new note.
    - I want to be able to edit and delete these notes.
    - I want specific notes saved to a specific video.
    - I want to be able to see all the notes I've made on the video I'm currently watching in the popup.
    - I want to be able to visit any links I post in my note on a new tab.
    - I want to be able to click on a note and have the video I'm watching jump to the associated time.
    - I want to be able to make a note at any time (paused or unpaused).
    - Only my notes are viewable to me.
    - I am only allowed 200 characters per note.

#### Our IceBox
- As a user...
    - I want to be able to use this extension on *any* site that has videos.
    - I want to be able to make new notes directly from a text area underneath the video.
    - I want to see a bar underneath the video that shows at what time in the video notes are being held via little markings.
    - I want to see my notes pop up beside/underneath/over/above the video as I'm watching, when the time I made the note at comes up.
    - I want to have the *option* of seeing other people's notes on the video I'm watching.
